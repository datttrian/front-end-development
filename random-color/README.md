# Random Color Picker

In this project, we’ll build a program that helps designers think of new color schemes.

Our program will set the screen’s background to a random color.  Clicking a button will refresh to a new, random color.  [Random generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) are a well-known tool for breaking a creative rut.
